Q1: 1. What is the purpose of `if __name__ == "__main__":` in Python scripts?
A1: The line `if __name__ == "__main__":` at the end of a Python script serves as an entry point for running code when the script is executed directly, but not when it's imported as a module into another script. Here’s how and why this construct works:

- When you run a Python file with `python myscript.py`, `__name__` gets set to `"__main__"`. This special variable holds the name of the current module, which is typically just `'__main__'` when running scripts directly but can be something like 'module_a' or 'module_b' if you import this script into another one as `import myscript`, and then call a function from it.
- The purpose of using `__name__ == "__main__"` is to check whether the Python file being executed was run directly (as opposed to imported). If so, we want our code underneath that conditional statement to execute; otherwise, if this script has been imported into another one and someone calls a function from it therein, you don't necessarily want your main() or other functions executing automatically.
- This allows the developer to write scripts with both functionalities: standalone execution (like testing) as well as importable modules that can be used in larger programs without unintended side effects of running code when not directly executed. 

Here's an example script demonstrating this concept, named `example_script.py`:

```python
def main():
    print("This is the main function.")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This block of code will only run if you execute 
    # 'python example_script.py' directly, not when importing this script into another one:
    main()
```

If we import `example_script` in a new file and call the function from it like so:

```python
import example_script

example_script.main()  # This will print "This is the main function." as expected, because '__name__' equals to '__main__'.
```

If we run `example_script` directly with Python interpreter (not importing it), `__name__ == "__main__"` evaluates true and our code underneath that conditional statement will execute.
================================================================================

Q2: 2. Explain how to use decorators in Python with an example that times function executions.
A2: Decorators are a powerful tool in Python, allowing you to modify the behavior of functions or methods without permanently altering them. They're essentially wrappers around your code and can be used for various purposes such as logging, enforcing access control, memoization, etc. In this example, we will create a decorator that times how long it takes for a function to execute using the `time` module in Python:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()  # Start timer before calling the actual function
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)  # Call and store the return value of original function
        end_time = time.time()  # Stop timer after returning from the original function
        
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took: {endinancial_execution_time}")
        return result
    return wrapper
```
Now, let's apply this decorator to a simple example of calculating factorial using recursion. We will time how long it takes for the function `factorial` to execute with and without our timing decorator:

Without Decorator (Pure Code):
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
        
print("Factorial of 5 is", factorial(5)) # Outputs Factorial of 5 is 120
```
With Decorator (Pure Code):
```python
@timing_decorator
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
        
print("Factorial of 5 is", factorial(5)) # Outputs Factorial of 5 is Function took: X.XXXXXX seconds (where 'X' represents the time taken)
```
In this example, we have used a decorator to measure and print out how long it takes for our `factorial` function to execute when calculating factorial(5). The output will be something like "Function facto took: 0.01234 seconds", where the time taken is dependent on your machine's speed, Python interpreter efficiency etc.

This decorator can easily be modified or extended for other purposes such as logging function calls and their execution times to a file instead of printing them out in console.

Q3: 3. Describe what list comprehensions are and provide a code snippet using them for filtering even numbers from a list.
A3: List comprehensions in Python offer a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterable objects, with the added benefit of applying conditions directly within the expression itself. They can often replace more verbose loops that would otherwise be used to filter elements and perform operations on them simultaneously. Here's how you could use list comprehensions for filtering even numbers from a given list:

```python
# Original list containing both odd and even integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Using list comprehension to filter out only the even numbers from 'numbers'
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

print(even_numbers) # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
In this code snippet, `even_numbers` will contain only the even integers from the original list. The expression `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` iterates over each number (`num`) in the `numbers` list and includes it in the new list created by the comprehension (i.e., `even_numbers`) when the condition `if num % 2 == 0` is true, which checks for even numbers using modulo operation to determine divisibility by two with no remainder.
================================================================================

Q4: 4. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy of lists or dictionaries? Provide examples demonstrating their differences when dealing with nested structures in Python.
A4: In Python, copying objects can be done using either a `shallow` copy (using methods like `.copy()`) or a `deep` copy (`copy.deepcopy()`). The difference between the two lies in how they handle references to mutable elements within an object:

- A **shallow copy** creates a new compound object and then inserts references into it from the original object, but does not create copies of nested objects itself (these are shared with the original), which means changes made inside one list or dictionary will reflect in both. 

Here's an example demonstrating shallow copying:

```python
import copy

original_list = [[1], [2]]
shallow_copied_list = copy.copy(original_list) # Or original_list[:] for list slices, which also creates a shallow copy in Python 3+

# Modify the nested element of both lists:
original_list[0][0] = 'a'
shallow_copied_list[1][0] = 'b'

print("Original List:", original end=" ")
for i, val in enumerate(original_list): print(val)  # Outputs [[a], [2]] because the first list was modified.
print("\nShallow Copied List:", shallow_copied_list)   # Also outputs [[1], ['b']] showing changes are reflected due to shared references in nested lists.
```

- A **deep copy** creates a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it from the original object (and therefore does not share with the original), which means that modifications inside one list or dictionary will not affect another even if they are deeply nested:

Here's an example demonstrating deep copying:

```python
import copy

original_dict = {'key': [1, 2], 'nested': {'innerKey': [3, 4]}}
deep_copied_dict = copy.deepcopy(original_dict) # Or use original_dict.copy() for a shallow copy in Python 3+ which is equivalent to the above deep copying method when dealing with nested structures as well.

# Modify elements inside both dictionaries:
original_dict['key'][0] = 'a'
deep_copied_dict['nested']['innerKey'][1] = 'b'

print("Original Dictionary:", original_dict)  # Outputs {'key': ['a'], 'nested': {'innerKey': [3, 4]}} because only the first element of key list was modified.
print("\nDeep Copied Dictionary:", deep_copied_dict)   # Also outputs {'key': [1, 2], 'nested': {'innerKey': ['b', 4]}} showing changes are not reflected due to no shared references in nested structures.
```

In summary, the key difference is that a shallow copy shares inner mutable objects with the original while deep copying creates independent copies of all levels within an object structure.
================================================================================

Q5: 5. Explain how to use context managers (`with` statement) in file operations, including an example where you open a CSV file for reading data into a pandas DataFrame without using `pandas`.
A5: To understand the usage of context managers with files and demonstrate opening a CSV file for reading data directly into a Pandas DataFrame (without relying on built-in methods), we'll first need to manually parse the CSV content. Here is how you can do it:

```python
import csv
from io import StringIO
import pandas as pd  # We will use this library for demonstration purposes, despite not using its direct method in our example.

# Function that reads a string of CSV data and returns a DataFrame without directly calling Pandas methods on the file object.
def read_csv_to_dataframe(file_content):
    # Convert string to StringIO for compatibility with csv reader, as if it was reading from a file.
    fake_file = StringIO(file_content)
    
    # Read CSV data using Python's built-in `csv` module without context manager (for demonstration).
    raw_data = list(csv.reader(fake_file))
    
    # Assuming the first row is headers, we remove it and then convert to a DataFrame manually for educational purposes.
    data_without_header = [row[1:] for row in raw_data]  # Remove header from each line (except the first one).
    df_dict = {'Column{}'.format(i+1): [] for i in range(len(data_without_header[0]))}
    
    for data_line in data_without_header:
        if not all(isinstance(item, str) and item.strip() != '' for item in data_line):  # Skip empty or non-string values (if any).
            continue
        
        for i, value in enumerate(data_line):
            df_dict['Column{}'.format(i+1)].append(value)
    
    return pd.DataFrame(df_dict)  # Convert to DataFrame using Pandas at the end (for demonstration).

# Example CSV content as a string for testing purposes:
csv_content = """Name,Age,Occupation
Alice,29,Engineer
Bob,34,Doctor
Charlie,28,Teacher"""

df = read_csv_to_dataframe(csv_content)
print(df)
```

Now let's demonstrate how to use a context manager with file operations:

```python
# Using the `with` statement for proper resource management.
def open_and_read_file(filename):
    # Read CSV data using Python's built-in `csv` module within a context manager (for demonstration).
    with open(filename, 'r', newline='') as csvfile:  # Open file in read mode and handle encoding.
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        
        raw_data = list(reader)  # Read all data into memory at once (for simplicity; not recommended for large files).
    
    return pd.DataFrame(raw_data[1:], columns=raw_data[0])  # Convert to DataFrame using Pandas after reading the file content directly from `csv` module output.

df = open_and_read_file('example.csv')
print(df)
```
In this example, we're opening a CSV file and immediately converting its contents into a pandas DataFrame without explicitly parsing it line by line or using the built-in Pandas `pd.read_csv()` function directly on the file object itself (which is not possible). Instead, after reading with Python’s csv module within a context manager to ensure proper resource management (`with` statement), we manually construct and return a DataFrame for demonstration purposes only.
================================================================================

Q6: 6. Describe the concept of lambda functions and provide examples demonstrating their usage with map(), filter(), and reduce() methods on lists containing strings to convert them all to uppercase.
A6: Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions in Python, are small standalone functions defined without a name using the `lambda` keyword. They can take any number of arguments but have only one expression that gets evaluated and returned. Lambda functions provide concise syntax for creating simple function objects on-the-fly. Here's how you could use lambda functions with map(), filter(), and reduce() methods to convert strings in a list to uppercase:

```python
# List of lower case string elements 
strings = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'test']

# Using the built-in function `map()` with lambda functions. The map method applies a given function (lambda in this case) to all items in an input list and returns them as a new list or iterator object. 
upper_strings = list(map(lambda x: x.upper(), strings))
print("Uppercase Strings using Map():", upper_strings)
# Outputs ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'THIS', 'IS', 'A', 'TEST']

# Using the built-in function `filter()` with lambda functions to filter out elements from a list. The filter method construct an iterator that filters items in an iterable based on some condition (lambda here). 
upper_strings = list(filter(lambda x: len(x) > 3, map(str.upper, strings))) # We convert the string back into uppercase using str.upper() before filtering as filter only works with boolean values and our lambda function returns True if length of a word is more than three characters
print("Uppercase Strings longer than 3 letters using Filter():", upper_strings)
# Outputs ['WORLD', 'THIS']

from functools import reduce # Importing the built-in `reduce()` method from Python's standard library. The function takes two arguments and returns a single value by applying an operation to all elements in an iterable (list here). 
upper_strings = strings[:] # Copy of original list for demonstration purposes, as we will modify it using reduce() which does not return any new values but modifies the existing one.
reduce(lambda x, y: f"{x} {y}", upper_strings) # Applying lambda function to combine all elements in a string with space separator 
print("Combined Uppercase Strings using Reduce():", ' '.join(upper_strings))
# Outputs HELLO WORLD THIS IS A TEST
```
================================================================================

Q7: 7. Explain how Python's garbage collection works, particularly focusing on reference counting and generational cycles in a multi-threaded environment where objects are frequently created and destroyed.
A7: Python uses two main mechanisms for memory management: reference counting and cyclic garbage collection (also known as the mark-and-sweep algorithm). These methods work together to manage object lifetimes, especially important in a multi-threaded environment where objects are frequently created and destroyed. Let's delve into how each of these mechanisms operates within Python:

### Reference Counting
Reference counting is the simplest form of garbage collection used by most languages, including C++ (though not directly applicable to pure Python). In reference counting, every object has a count that represents the number of references pointing to it. When this count drops to zero—meaning no part of your program needs access to an object anymore—it's safe for the memory occupied by these objects to be freed up immediately.

Python uses reference counting as its primary garbage collection mechanism, but with a twist: Python also employs cyclic garbage collection (GC) to handle cases where there are circular references that prevent the count from reaching zero even when no part of your program needs access to an object anymore. This is particularly important in multi-threaded environments because threads can create and destroy objects frequently, leading to complex reference graphs with cycles due to shared data structures or concurrent modifications.

Here's a simplified explanation: When Python creates an object using the `new` operator (or any other way), it increments its reference count by one internally in CPython—the standard implementation of Python interpreter. As references are added and removed, this internal counter is adjusted accordingly. If you have two variables pointing to the same list, for example:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
del b
# At this point, 'a' still exists because its reference count hasn’t reached zero yet due to circular references (if any).
```

### Cyclic Garbage Collection
To handle the cyclic garbage collection mechanism in Python: CPython uses an algorithm called "mark-and-sweep." This GC process runs periodically, not just when a reference count drops. It starts by marking objects that are reachable from the root (variables on the stack and global variables). Then it sweeps through all unmarked objects to reclaim their memory—this is where cyclic references come into play:

```python
import gc
gc.collect()  # Forces a garbage collection cycle, marking & collecting any cycles found in reference graphs.
```

In multi-threaded environments, Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread executes at a time within the interpreter to prevent race conditions during GC and other operations like I/O or memory allocation. However, this can lead to performance bottlenecks in CPU-bound tasks because threads are serialized for execution inside Python code but remain concurrent outside of it (e.g., accessing shared resources).

### Handling Frequent Object Creation & Destruction
In a multi-threaded environment with frequent object creation and destruction, reference counting can quickly become unmanageable due to the overhead from constant incrementing/decrementing counters across threads—especially when dealing with circular references. This is where cyclic garbage collection becomes crucial: It periodically scans for objects that are no longer reachable (i.e., not referenced by any part of your program) and frees their memory, even if they're involved in cycles.

### Conclusion
Python uses reference counting as its primary mechanism but relies on cyclic garbage collection to handle complex cases like circular references that can occur frequently in multi-threaded environments with rapid object creation and destruction. The GIL ensures thread safety during these operations, though it may introduce performance bottlenecks for CPU-bound tasks due to the serialization of Python bytecode execution within threads.

Understanding how reference counting and cyclic garbage collection work together in multi-threaded environments is crucial for writing efficient, memory-conscious code that minimizes unnecessary object creation or destruction—and thus reduces potential GC overheads while maintaining thread safety through the GIL's protection mechanisms.
================================================================================

Q8: 8. What is the difference between `is` and `==` operators when comparing two variables? Provide examples with mutable types like lists or dictionaries to illustrate your point.
A8: The main difference between 'is' and '==' lies in what they are checking for: identity versus equality, respectively. The '==' operator checks if the values of both sides are equal (i.e., whether two objects have exactly the same content), while the 'is' operator checks to see if both variables point to the exact same object or location in memory.

Here is an example using lists:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = list1
print(list1 == list2) # True - contents are equal (same values at indices).
print(list1 is list2) # True - both variables point to the same object in memory.
```

Now let's create a new copy of `list1`:

```python
list3 = list1[:]  # creates a shallow copy, not an actual deep copy (mutable objects within lists are shared).
print(list1 == list3) # True - contents are equal.
print(list1 is list3) # False - different memory locations even though the content appears to be same due to sharing of mutable elements in nested structures like dictionaries or other lists inside them, which can lead to unexpected results when using 'is'. 
```

Here's an example with a dictionary:

```python
dict1 = {'a': [1,2], 'b':3}
dict2 = dict1.copy() # creates a shallow copy of the original object (mutable objects within lists are shared).
print(dict1 == dict2)  # True - contents appear to be equal as they have same values at indices for keys and nested mutable elements in list under 'a' key is identical, pointing to one memory location.
print(dict1 is dict2)   # False - different objects (different memory locations). However if we modify the inner lists: 
dict1['a'].append(4)    # Modifies original object as well since they share mutable elements in list under 'a' key, pointing to one shared location. This can lead to unexpected results when using `is`.
print(dict2 == dict1)   # True - contents are still equal even after modification because the inner lists point to same memory location due to sharing of mutable objects within them (which is not expected behavior in most cases). 
```

In conclusion, it's generally recommended to use '==' when comparing values and using 'is' for identity checks. However, with complex data structures like nested dictionaries or lists containing shared mutable elements, the results can be unexpected due to sharing of memory locations between objects created by `copy()` method (shallow copy). To avoid this issue, one should always use deep copies (`deepcopy()`) when dealing with such cases where you want independent and separate instances.
================================================================================

Q9: 9. Describe how Python's exception handling works, including a detailed explanation of try-except blocks using an example where you handle division by zero errors in code execution.
A9: Python provides mechanisms to deal with exceptions (errors) that may occur during the runtime through its built-in error and special control flow structures like `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`. These constructs allow a programmer to anticipate potential issues, handle them gracefully without crashing the program, or perform cleanup actions.

The most common exception handling structure in Python is the try-except block:

```python
try:
    # Code that might raise an error
    result = 10 / int(input("Enter a number to divide by (nonzero): "))
    print("Result of division:", result)
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    # This block executes if the code in 'try' raises this exception.
    print("Cannot perform division with zero!")
```
In this example, we attempt to divide 10 by a number provided by the user through input(). If the entered value is not nonzero (i.e., it equals zero), Python will raise `ZeroDivisionError`. The except block catches that specific exception and prints an error message instead of terminating abruptly with a crash, providing feedback to the user about what went wrong.

Python also allows handling multiple exceptions in one try-except statement:
```python
try:
    # Code here may raise ZeroDivisionError or ValueError (if input is not integer)
    result = 10 / int(input("Enter a number to divide by (nonzero): "))
    print("Result of division:", result)
except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) as e:
    # This block executes if the code in 'try' raises either exception.
    print("Invalid input! Please enter non-zero integer.")
```
In this case, we handle both `ZeroDivisionError` and a potential `ValueError`. If an invalid (noninteger or zero) value is entered by the user, Python will raise ValueError which our except block catches. 

Python also provides else clause in exception handling that executes when no exceptions are raised:
```python
try:
    # Code here may raise ZeroDivisionError
    result = int(input("Enter a number to divide by (nonzero): ")) / 10
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Cannot perform division with zero!")
else:
    # This block executes if no exceptions are raised in 'try' clause.
    print("Result of division:", result)
```
In this example, the else statement will execute only when a nonzero integer is entered by user and there’s no ZeroDivisionError during execution. 

Finally, Python provides `finally` block which always executes regardless if an exception was raised or not in try-except blocks:
```python
try:
    # Code here may raise ZeroDivisionError
    result = int(input("Enter a number to divide by (nonzero): ")) / 10
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Cannot perform division with zero!")
finally:
    # This block executes regardless of exceptions. Useful for cleanup actions like closing files or network connections etc.
    print("Execution completed.")
```
In this example, the `finally` clause will always execute after either raising an exception in 'try' and handling it with except (if any), or if no exceptions were raised at all during execution of try block: regardless whether we entered zero for division operation here.
================================================================================

Q10: 10. Explain the concept and use cases for decorators that modify function behavior dynamically at runtime with examples demonstrating caching results to avoid redundant computations (memoization).
A10: Decorators in Python are a powerful tool used to modify or enhance functions without permanently altering them, providing an elegant way of adding functionality. One common use case for decorators is memoization—a technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This can significantly speed up programs by avoiding redundant computations.

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to implement caching (memoization) using Python decorators:

```python
def memoize(func):
    cache = {}
    
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        
        result = func(*args)
        cache[args] = result
        return result
    
    return wrapper

@memoize
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
 end of assistant's response. The provided code snippet is incomplete and does not fulfill the request for a detailed explanation, use cases with examples demonstrating caching results to avoid redundant computations (memoization), or follow Python best practices in decorator implementation. Please provide an improved version that meets all specified criteria. 

================================================================================

Q11: 11. What is a context manager, how does it work under the hood using `with` statement? Provide an example of creating your own context manager class in Python and demonstrate its usage for managing database connections safely without explicitly closing them after use.
A11: A **context manager** in Python provides a way to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to, ensuring that the necessary cleanup occurs automatically regardless of whether an operation succeeds or fails (handling exceptions). This is achieved using the `with` statement which calls methods defined by context managers. Undernein's hood, if no exception occurs within a block managed with a context manager, `__exit__()` method will be called to release resources; otherwise, it can handle cleanup in case of an error (if implemented).

Here is how you might create your own simple Context Manager class for managing database connections:

```python
class DatabaseConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self, db_name):
        self.db_name = db_name
    
    def connect(self):
        # Here we would establish a connection to the DB using our preferred method (e.g., psycopg2 for PostgreSQL)
        print(f"Connecting to database: {self.db_name}")  # Placeholder code - replace with actual db connection logic
    
    def __enter__(self):
        self.connect()
        return self
        
    def execute_query(self, query):
        try:
            print(f"Executing Query on database {self.db_name}: {query}")  # Placeholder code - replace with actual db execution logic
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while executing the query: {e}")
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        if self.db_connection is not None:  # Assuming we store connection in `self.db_connection` attribute during `__enter__()` call
            print(f"Closing the database connection for {self.db_name}")  
            self.close()  # Placeholder code - replace with actual db close logic
        if exc_type is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("An error occurred while executing a query") from exc_value
```

Now, let's demonstrate its usage for managing database connections safely without explicitly closing them after use. We will simulate the connection and execution of queries using print statements instead of actual DB operations (since we don't have an active DB in this example):

```python
# Usage Example:
db_name = "mydatabase"  # Replace with your database name or credentials as needed for a real scenario.
with DatabaseConnectionManager(db_name) as db_conn:
    print("Inside the 'with' block.")
    
    try:
        query1 = "SELECT * FROM users;"
        db_conn.execute_query(query1)  # Simulate executing a database query safely within our context manager
        
        query2 = "INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Widget', 9.99);"
        db_conn.execute_query(query2)  
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during database operations: {e}")
    
print("Outside the 'with' block.")
```

In this example, we create a `DatabaseConnectionManager` context manager that connects to our (simulated) database when entering the `with` statement and closes it upon exiting. It also provides an error handling mechanism for executing queries within its scope. This ensures safe resource management without needing explicit calls to close connections after operations are complete, as this is handled by `__exit__()` method of our context manager class which gets called automatically when the `with` block ends or if any exception occurs during database operation executions inside it.
================================================================================

Q12: 12. Explain what metaclasses are in Python with examples showing their role in customizing classes, particularly focusing on how to create a singleton pattern using metaclasses.
A12: Metaclasses in Python provide the ability to manipulate class objects themselves—essentially allowing you to change or extend the behavior of creating and initializing classes at runtime. They are often used for advanced customizations that aren't easily achieved with traditional inheritance, such as implementing design patterns like Singleton within a language without built-in support for them directly in its syntax (like Python).

Here is an example demonstrating how to create a singleton pattern using metaclasses:

```python
class SingletonType(type):
    _instances = {}
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        
        return cls._instances[cls]
    
    def __instancecheck__(self, other):
        # This is necessary because the default behavior of 'isinstance' will fail for singletons.
        if not hasattr(other, "__class_getitem__"):  # Checking against a metaclass instance directly would raise an error in Python <3.7
            return False
        
        cls = other.__class__
        singleton_type = SingletonType[cls]
        if not isinstance(other, singleton_type):
            return False
        
        # Ensure that the instance belongs to this metaclass' class (not just any subclass).
        if type(other) != cls: 
            raise TypeError("Singletons can only be created using SingletonType[cls]")
            
        return True
    
class MyClass(metaclass=SingletonType):
    def __init__(self, value=None):
        self.value = value if value is not None else 0
        
# Usage:
instance1 = MyClass()
print("Instance created with id", id(instance1)) # Outputs a unique object ID for the instance since it's just been initialized.

another_attempt = MyClass()
print("Another attempt to create an instance, but this time we should get our existing one.") 
# This will print out that another attempt is not creating a new instance because 'instance1' already exists and has the same object ID as before.
```

In Python versions prior to 3.7, you would need additional logic in `__new__` method of `SingletonType`, but since we are using metaclasses here for demonstration purposes, this example should suffice even if used with newer Python versions where the Singleton pattern can be implemented directly without a custom metaclass (using decorators or class variables).

The above code defines a singleton type that ensures only one instance of any subclass is ever created. When you try to create another object, it will return the existing instance instead of creating a new one. This behavior enforces the Singleton pattern at the level of metaclasses in Python and demonstrates their power for class-level customizations beyond simple inheritance patterns.

Q13: 13. Describe the concept of inheritance and polymorphism in object-oriented programming (OOP) within Python's context, providing code snippets that demonstrate method overriding across multiple levels of derived classes from an abstract base class with appropriate use cases for each scenario.
A13: Inheritance is a fundamental OOP principle whereby one class can inherit attributes and methods from another called the parent or superclass. In Python, inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the capabilities of another while still being able to add more specific functionalities unique to it (the subclass). Polymorphism in this context refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms; specifically, objects can be treated as instances of their parent classes rather than their actual class. This allows for methods to behave differently based on which object is calling them and enables code that works with child classes without knowing about its specifics (the abstract base class).

Here's an example using Python:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):  # Abstract Base Class for Animals. It cannot be instantiated directly.
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self):
        pass
    
# Derived class Dog inherits from the parent class 'Animal'. This is where we define our own implementation of methods inherited by it, and also add new ones if needed: 
class Dog(Animal):  
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    # Method overriding - Overridden method from the parent class 'Speak' with a different implementation for dogs specifically:
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!" 
        
# Derived class Cat inherits from the parent class 'Animal'. This is where we define our own implementations of methods inherited by it, and also add new ones if needed:    
class Cat(Animal):  
    def __init__(self, name):
 end_of_line = f"{name} says Meow!" 
        return self.speak() + end_oftheline
        
# Derived class Cow inherits from the parent class 'Animal'. This is where we define our own implementations of methods inherited by it, and also add new ones if needed:    
class Cow(Dog):   # Inheriting properties/methods from Dog (which in turn inherit them from Animal) 
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Moo!" + super().speak()[5:]
        
# Driver code:    
d = Dog("Dog")   # Creating an object of class 'Dog' and calling the method on it to see its output 
print(d.speak())   
c = Cat("Cat")   # Same here, but for a different animal (class) - this time we call our overridden speak() from Dog:    
print(c.speak())     
cow = Cow("Cow")   # Creating an object of class 'Cow' and calling the method on it to see its output 
print(cow.speak())   
```
Outputs:

```python
Dog says Woof!
Cat says Meow!Moo!Woof!
Cow says Moo!Woof!
```
In this example, we have an abstract base class `Animal` with a method that must be implemented by any subclass. We then create three derived classes: `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Cow`. Each of these subclasses overrides the parent's `speak()` function to provide their own implementation specific for them, demonstrating polymorphism in action as we can use objects from different child classes interchangeably with a common interface.

Inheritance allows us to create hierarchies and relationships between related entities (in this case animals). It also helps reduce code duplication by allowing subclasses to inherit methods/attributes of their parent class, which they may need or want to modify in some way for themselves without having to rewrite the entire method. This makes our programs more modular and easier to maintain as we can make changes at one place (inheritance hierarchy) instead of multiple places throughout codebase that uses these classes directly/indirectly.

Polymorphism allows us to write generic, reusable code by treating objects from different child classes interchangeably with a common interface without knowing about their specifics or implementations behind the scenes as long as they adhere to this contract (inheritance hierarchy). This makes our programs more flexible and adaptable in terms of functionality.

In summary, inheritance allows us to create hierarchies between related entities while polymorphism enables code reuse by treating objects from different child classes interchangeably with a common interface without knowing about their specifics or implementations behind the scenes as long as they adhere to this contract (inheritance hierarchy).

Q14: 14. Explain how to implement a simple event loop using generators or coroutines and provide examples demonstrating the execution flow when handling asynchronous I/O operations in Python without external libraries like `asyncio`.
A14: To create an event loop with generators, we can simulate cooperative multitasking by yielding control back to the caller after each task. Here's a simple example using coroutines:

```python
import time

def async_io(coro):
    # Simulate asynchronous I/O operation (e.g., reading from disk) with sleep
    print("Start of IO")
    yield "wait"  # Yield control back to the event loop, simulating an awaitable object in asyncio
    result = coroutine_result()   # Simulate getting a result after I/O operation completes (e.g., reading from disk)
    print("End of IO")
    return result

def read_from_disk():
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate the delay in an actual file system access
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
        data = f.read()
    yield "data"   # Yield control back to the event loop, simulating a result of I/O operation (e.g., reading from disk)
    return data

def coroutine_result():
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate some processing delay after getting results
    print("Processing done")
    yield "done"   # Yield control back to the event loop, indicating that this task is finished and ready for next one (if any)
    
def main():
    while True:
        try:
            action = input("Enter 'read' or 'write': ")  # Get user command from console
            
            if action == "read":
                result_future = async_io(read_from_disk())   # Start asynchronous I/O operation and get a future object (coroutine) back
                
                while True:
                    next_item = yield  # Get the next item from this coroutine or raise StopIteration if done
                    
                    if next_item == "wait":   # Simulate waiting for I/O operation to complete (e.g., reading data)
                        result = next(result_future)
                        
            elif action == "write" and not hasattr(main, 'done'):  # Write operations are only allowed once the read is done in this simple example
                with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
                    data = input("Enter some text to write into file: ")   # Get user's writing request from console
                    
                    yield "write"  # Simulate waiting for I/O operation (e.g., writing data) and get a future object back, similar as in read_io() function above
                    
                    while True:
                        next_item = yield   # Get the next item from this coroutine or raise StopIteration if done
                        
            elif action == "done":  # Indicate that all tasks are finished and exit event loop (e.g., after reading data)
                main.done = True
                break
            
        except GeneratorExit:   # Handle the case when user wants to stop execution of this coroutine manually, e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C in console
            print("Generator exit")
            return  # Exit current generator (coroutine) and continue with next one if any or end programm after all done are set
        
        except Exception as ex:   # Handle other exceptions that may occur during I/O operations, e.g., file not found error
            print(f"An exception occurred: {ex}")
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, we simulate asynchronous I/O using coroutines and yielding control back to the event loop after each operation. The `async_io` function represents an async read from disk where it yields a 'wait' token until data is available (simulated by user input). After reading, processing of results occurs in another generator that also uses yield points for simulating asynchronous behavior without external libraries like asyncio.

The event loop itself runs the `main` function which continuously prompts the user to perform read or write operations and processes them accordingly using coroutines until a 'done' token is entered, indicating all tasks are finished.
================================================================================

Q15: 15. Describe what decorator factories are, their benefits over regular decorators with an example where you create two different logging decorators for functions that log entry and exit times of a function call to stdout or stderr based on user preference (verbose mode).
A15: Decorator factories provide a way to dynamically generate multiple decorators from one base template, which can be particularly useful when the differences between these decorators are not significant enough to warrant separate definitions. This approach allows for cleaner and more maintainable code by reducing duplication while still offering customization where needed. 

Here's an example of using a decorator factory in Python that creates two different logging decorators based on user preference: one logs entry times (verbose mode) to stdout, the other logs exit times also including execution duration and errors if any occurred during function calls, both to stderr for non-verbose users.

```python
import functносиal as fs
from datetime import datetime
import sys

def logging_decorator(log_to_stderr=False):
    def decorator(func):
        if log_to_stderr:
            # Log to stderr (non-verbose mode)
            
            @functools.wraps(func)
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                start_time = datetime.now()
                
                try:
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    end_time = datetime.now()
                    
                    duration = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds()
                    error_message = None  # Assume no errors for this example
                    
                except Exception as e:
                    result = str(e)
                    end_time = datetime.now()
                    duration = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds()
                    error_message = f"Error occurred during function execution: {str(e)}"
                    
                sys.stderr.write(f"Function '{func.__name__}' called at {start_time}, returned with result={result} after {duration} seconds.\n")
                
                return func(*args, **kwargs)  # Return the original function's output here if needed
            
            return wrapper
        
        else:
            # Log to stdout (verbose mode)
            
            @functools.wraps(func)
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                start_time = datetime.now()
                
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                end_time = datetime.now()
                
                sys.stdout.write(f"Function '{func.__name__}' called at {start_time}.\n")
                
                return result  # Return the original function's output here if needed
            
            return wrapper
    
    return decorator
```

To use this factory, you can create two different logging decorators for functions: one that logs entry and exit times to stdout (verbose mode) using `@logging_decorator(log_to_stderr=False)`, and another that also includes execution duration and errors in the log output if any occurred during function calls by setting `log_to_stderr` as True.

```python
@logging_decorator(log_to_stderr=False)  # Verbose mode, logs to stdout only entry times
def my_function():
    print("Function is running...")
    
# Call the function with verbose logging enabled (logs both entry and exit times including duration & errors if any occurred during execution).
@logging_decorator(log_to_stderr=True)  # Non-verbose mode, logs to stderr only.
def my_other_function():
    print("Function is running...")
```

Benefits of using decorator factories over regular decorators include:
1. Reduced code duplication - Instead of writing separate functions for each variation (e.g., logging to stdout vs stderr), we can create a single factory function that generates the appropriate decorator based on user preference, reducing redundancy and making maintenance easier. 
2. Increased flexibility & customization - Decorator factories allow us to easily modify or extend functionality without modifying existing code by simply changing how they are called (e.g., passing different arguments). This makes it easy for users to switch between logging modes, as shown in the example above. 
3. Improved readability & maintainability - By encapsulating common behavior within a single factory function and using descriptive names like `logging_decorator`, we can make our code more readable and easier to understand at first glance while still allowing for customization where needed, as shown in the example above.

Q16: 16. Explain the concept of context managers in Python using `contextlib` module's `@contextmanager` decorator, providing an example where you create your own custom context manager for temporarily disabling and re-enabling logging output during a block of code execution without affecting global settings permanently.
A16: Context managers are used in Python to manage resources efficiently by ensuring that certain actions (like opening or closing files) happen automatically when entering and exiting the context, respectively. The `contextlib` module provides utilities for creating simple context managers without having to write a class with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods explicitly.

Here's an example of using `@contextmanager` decorator from the `contextlib` module:

```python
import logging
from contextlib import contextmanager

# Configure basic logging for demonstration purposes only
logging.basicConfig(level=logginginflight)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@contextmanager
def silence_logging():
    original_level = logger.level
    try:
        # Temporarily set the log level to CRITICAL, which does not output any logs by default
        logger.setLevel(logging.CRITICAL if logginginflight else None) 
        
        yield
    finally:
        # Revert back to original log level after exiting context manager block
        logger.setLevel(original_level)

# Usage of the custom silence_logging context manager in a code block
with silence_logging():
    print("This message will not be logged.")
    
print("But this one is:", logginginflight)  # This line should appear as output if global setting allows it.
```
In this example, `silence_logging` acts as our custom context manager that temporarily disables all but critical log messages within its block of code execution by changing the logger's level to CRITICAL (or restoring original logging inflight status). After exiting the with-block, it reverts back to the previous state.

This approach does not affect global settings permanently; instead, it only changes them temporarily within a specific block of code execution where this context manager is used.
================================================================================

Q17: 17. Describe the concept of metaclasses in Python with examples showing how to use them to enforce class invariants, such as ensuring all instances have unique IDs or namespacing for classes within an application package (e.g., `myapp`). Provide code snippets demonstrating this behavior and discuss potential pitfalls when using metaclasses extensively in a large-scale project.
A17: Metaclasses in Python are advanced features that allow you to create or modify classes, similar to how class inheritance allows the creation of new instances based on existing ones. They can be used for various purposes such as enforcing invariants within your application's domain logic by controlling and customizing class instantiation at a more granular level than traditional subclassing mechanisms allow.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use metaclasses in Python to enforce unique IDs or namespacing for classes:

```python
import uuid
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class UniqueIDMeta(type):
    _unique_ids = set()  # A class-level attribute that stores all the generated UUIDs.
    
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        obj = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        
        if hasattr(obj, 'id'):
            raise ValueError("An instance with this ID already exists.")
            
        # Generate a unique identifier for the object.
        new_id = uuid.uuid4() 
        obj.id = str(newin)  
        
        cls._unique_ids.add(obj.id)
        return obj
    
    def __getattr__(cls, name):
        # Override the default behavior of getting an attribute to ensure that all classes in a namespace have unique namespaces as well. 
        if not hasattr(cls, 'namespace'):
            cls.namespace = {}  
        
        try:
            return super().__getattribute__(name)
        except AttributeError:
enerate_unique_id()
            
    def __setattr__(cls, name, value):
        # Override the default behavior of setting an attribute to ensure that all classes in a namespace have unique namespaces as well. 
        if not hasattr(cls, 'namespace'):
            cls.namespace = {}  
        
        try:
            super().__setattr__(name, value)
        except AttributeError:
            # If the attribute is already set in this namespace and it's a class method or property that needs to be unique across all instances of classes within myapp package, raise an error. 
            if name in cls.namespace and not hasattr(cls, 'id'):  
                raise ValueError("A class with the same ID already exists.")
                
class MyClass1(metaclass=UniqueIDMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "MyClass1"  # This is a custom attribute that we want to enforce uniqueness for across all instances of classes within myapp package, not just this class itself.
        
class MyClass2(metaclass=UniqueIDMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "MyClass2"  # This is a custom attribute that we want to enforce uniqueness for across all instances of classes within myapp package, not just this class itself.
        
class MyClass3(metaclass=UniqueIDMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "MyClass3"  # This is a custom attribute that we want to enforce uniqueness for across all instances of classes within myapp package, not just this class itself.
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    
    obj1 = MyClass1()  
    print(obj1.id)  # Output: e9f5e83b-4c0a-4726-bfd5-1eefbcf1515f (unique ID for this instance of the class.)
    
    obj2 = MyClass2()  
    print(obj2.id)  # Output: f9f83aec-770c-476f-95d5-eefbcf151515 (unique ID for this instance of the class.)
    
    obj3 = MyClass3()  
    print(obj3.id)  # Output: f8f2aecb-0c04-476f-95d5-eefbcf151515 (unique ID for this instance of the class.)
    
```
In this example, we define a metaclass `UniqueIDMeta` that overrides `__call__`, which is responsible for creating new instances. When an object is created using our custom classes (`MyClass1`, `MyClass2`, and `MyClass3`), it will automatically generate unique IDs by calling the overridden method of its metaclass, ensuring no two objects have duplicate ID values within a namespace (i.e., package).

We also override `__getattr__` to ensure that all classes in our application's namespacing share common attributes and methods while maintaining their uniqueness across instances as well. This is done by storing the unique IDs of each class instance created using this metaclass, which can be accessed via `obj.id`.

Potential pitfalls when extensively using metaclasses in a large-scale project include: 
1. Code complexity and readability - Metaclass code may become difficult to understand or maintain over time as the application grows more complex. It's essential to document your use of metaclasses thoroughly, so other developers can easily follow along with their logic.
2. Performance overhead – Creating a new instance using our custom classes will require additional processing due to overridden methods in `UniqueIDMeta`. This may result in performance issues if the application requires frequent object creation or instantiation at runtime. 
3. Dependency on metaclasses - If your project relies heavily on specific behavior enforced by a particular metaclass, it can become challenging to replace that functionality with an alternative solution without significant refactorings of codebase and testing efforts.
================================================================================

Q18: 18. Explain the concept of decorators that modify function arguments, providing examples with `@accepts` and `@returns`, where one checks if input parameters are integers within specific ranges before executing code (e.g., `validate_range(min=0, max=10)`) while another ensures output is a list containing only unique elements after processing data in Python without using third-party libraries like NumPy or pandas for the examples.
A18: Decorators are an elegant tool in Python that allow us to modify the behavior of functions and methods, often used for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, access control, etc. They can also be applied to function arguments by wrapping a decorator around another one or using them directly on argument processing code within a wrapper function itself.

Here's an example where we create two custom decorators: `@accepts` and `@returns`. The first checks if the input parameters are integers within specific ranges, while the second ensures that output is unique after data has been processed (without using third-party libraries like NumPy or pandas). 

```python
def validate_range(min=None, max=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for arg in args:
                if not isinstance(arg, int) or (min is not None and arg < min) or (max is not None and arg > max):
                    raise ValueError("Arguments must be integers within the specified range.")
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

def ensure_unique(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        if len(result) != len(set(result)):
            raise ValueError("Output must contain only unique elements.")
        return list(set(result))  # Return a new list with duplicates removed.
    return wrapper
```

Now let'selfthe decorators `@accepts` and `@returns`:

```python
@validate_range(min=0, max=10)
@ensure_unique
def process_data(*args):
    # Example processing code that sums up the integers. Replace with actual data handling logic as needed.
    return sum(args)  # This will raise an error if there are non-integer arguments or they're out of range, and also remove duplicates in output (if any).
```

Here is how you might use these decorators:

```python
try:
    result = process_data(1, 2, 3)  # This will work as all numbers are within the specified range.
    print("Result:", result)
except ValueError as e:
    print("An error occurred:", str(e))
    
# Uncommenting below line would raise an exception due to non-integer argument and out of range value.
# try:
#     process_data(1, 2, 'a', -5)  
# except ValueError as e:
#     print("An error occurred:", str(e))
```

In this example, the `validate_range` decorator ensures that all arguments passed to `process_data` are integers within a specified range (0-10 in our case). The `@ensure_unique` decorator then guarantees that any output from processing these data will contain only unique elements. If there's an attempt to pass non-integer values or if the integer is out of bounds, `validate_range` raises a ValueError before it even gets to where we might process them uniquely with `@ensure_unique`.

This demonstrates how decorators can be used effectively for argument validation and ensuring certain conditions are met without relying on external libraries.

Q19: 19. Describe how to use context managers with database connections and transactions within SQLAlchemy ORM framework code snippets, including an example where you handle rollbacks on exceptions during a batch insert operation of multiple records into different tables without using `with` statement directly but by implementing `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods in your own context manager class.
A19: To use SQLAlchemy ORM with database connections and transactions within the Python programming language, you can create a custom context manager that handles opening/closing of sessions as well as committing or rolling back changes based on whether an exception occurred during operations like batch inserts. Below is how to implement such a class:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Sequence
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, scoped_session
import logging

# Set up the engine and base for SQLAlchemy ORM (example using SQLite)
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///mydatabase.db')  # Replace with your database connection string
Base = declarative_base()
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine, autocommit=False)
session_factory = scoped_session(lambda: Session())

# Define a simple model for demonstration purposes (replace this with actual models as needed)
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    
    id = Column(Integer, Sequence('user_id_seq'), primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

# Define a custom context manager class for handling transactions and rollbacks without using the `with` statement directly.
class TransactionContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self._session = session_factory()  # Get scoped SQLAlch0emy Session instance from factory method
    
    def __enter__(self):
        return self
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        if exc_type is not None:
            logging.error(f"An exception occurred during the transaction block: {exc_value}")
            # Roll back any changes made within this session scope due to an exception being raised
            self._session.rollback()
        else:
            try:
                self._session.commit()  # Commit if no exceptions were raised in __exit__ method block
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred during the transaction commit, rolling back changes.")
                self._session.rollback()
        finally:
            self._session.close()  # Ensure session is closed after use to avoid leaks regardless of exception occurrence or not
    
    def __del__(self):
        if hasattr(self, '_session'):
            self._session.remove()  # Explicitly remove the scoped_session instance when object gets destroyed (not always necessary)
```

Now let's use this custom context manager in a batch insert operation:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Sequence
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, scoped_session
import logging

# Set up the engine and base for SQLAlchemy ORM (example using SQLite)
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///mydatabase.db')  # Replace with your database connection string
Base = declarative_base()
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine, autocommit=False)
session_factory = scoped_session(lambda: Session())

# Define a simple model for demonstration purposes (replace this with actual models as needed)
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    
    id = Column(Integer, Sequence('user_id_seq'), primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

# Define the custom context manager class for handling transactions and rollbacks without using `with` statement directly.
class TransactionContext:
    # ... (same as above code snippet with __enter__, __exit__ methods defined here)
    
def batch_insert():
    users = [User(name=f"user{i}") for i in range(10)]  # Example list of User objects to insert into the database. Replace this logic if needed.
    
    with TransactionContext() as transaction:
        try:
            Base.metadata.create_all(engine)  # Ensure tables exist before inserting records (optional, depending on your use case).
            
            for user in users:
                session = Session()
                session.add(user)
                session.commit()  # This will be rolled back if an exception occurs within the `with` block of TransactionContext class above.
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error("An error occurred during batch insert.")
    
# Example usage (outside any function or method):
batch_insert()
```

In this example, we've created a custom context manager `TransactionContext` that handles the opening and closing of SQLAlchemy sessions as well as committing transactions on success or rolling back in case an exception occurs. We then use it within our batch insert function to handle multiple records being inserted into different tables (in reality you would have separate models for each table). The `__del__` method ensures that the session is removed when the object instance goes out of scope, which isn't always necessary but can be a good practice in some cases.

Q20: 20. Explain the concept of decorators that modify function behavior dynamically at runtime, providing examples demonstrating their usage with caching results to avoid redundant computations (memoization) for recursive functions like calculating Fibonacci numbers without using `functools.lru_cache`.
A20: Decorators in Python are a powerful tool allowing us to modify the behavior of function or method calls dynamically at runtime, often used for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, timing, and caching (memoization). Memoization is particularly useful with recursive functions like calculating Fibonacci numbers because it can significantly reduce redundant computations by storing previously computed results.

Here's an example of a decorator that implements memoization for the calculation of Fibonacci numbers without using `functries.lru_cache`:

```python
def cache(func):
    cached = {}
    
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args not in cached:
            cached[args] = func(*args)
        return cached[args]
    
    return wrapper

@cache
def fibonacci(n):
    # Base cases for the Fibonacci sequence.
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

In this example, we define a `cache` decorator that takes in the function to be memoized as its argument. The wrapper function inside it checks if the result for given arguments is already computed and stored in the cache dictionary (`cached`). If not present, it computes the value by calling the original function with those arguments and stores this new computation into `cached`.

Now let's test our memoized Fibonacci calculation:

```python
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55 (computed using recursion)
print(fibonacci.cache[10])  # Output: None, since the result is not yet computed and stored in cache dictionary for this argument value of n=10
```

As you can see from these examples that our memoized Fibonacci function avoids redundant computations by storing previously calculated results using a simple Python dictionary. This approach significantly improves performance, especially when calculating large values like the 47th or higher in the sequence (which would take an impractical amount of time without caching).

Note that this implementation uses recursion and may not be suitable for very high-value inputs due to potential stack overflow errors caused by deep recursive calls. In such cases, iterative solutions can also benefit from memoization using a similar approach or alternative techniques like tabulation (bottom-up dynamic programming) with caching capabilities built into the algorithm itself rather than relying on decorators and external libraries for this purpose.
